<h1>Barre Chords</h1>
<p>Barre chords are essential to guitar technique.  Even though many beginners may find them nearly impossible, with some practice over time you can achieve the 'impossible' and learn this super useful technique of playing barre chords.  Some knowledge of the musical alphabet is necessary to use barre chords effectively.  Each barre chord diagram will have a dot that is circled indicating that it is the root of the chord.  So if you need a B major chord you would move the barre chord shape to a fret location so that the circled dot is at letter B on the fretboard.  Yes, you need to know the letter names at the fretboard locations. If you don't already know the names of the notes on the fretboard you should start with learning string 6 (also string 1).</p>

<h2>Barre Technique</h2>
<p>
For barre chords, the basic concept is to use first finger as a 'barre', laying across several strings to fret all of those strings at that fret location.  Other finger may be played in the usual manner (curver finger shape) at other location on the fretboard.  The first barre chords are create by taking the basic chord shapes and changing them into barre forms.  As an example consider the E major chord.  A common LH ingering for that chord is first finger at str 3/fr 1, second finger at str 5/fr 2, third finger at str 4/fr 2.  If you change that to second finger at str 3/fr 1, third finger at str 5/fr 2, fourth finger at str 4/fr 2 then you have your first finger free to use the barre technique.  Form the chord as suggested above and move up the neck so you can lay your first finger down across all 6 strings at the 8th fret.  Your second finger should be at the 9th fret and your third and fourth fingers should both be at the 10th fret.  You have created a C major chord based on the E form.  The barre finger (first finger) lays across all six string however only strings 1, 2 and 6 are affected by the barre (the other strings have a different finger fretting them).  </p>
<p>
All of the basic chords can be modified to become barre chords.  This page shows many of the common barre forms that the intermediate student needs to master.</p>

<h2>Major Barre Chords</h2>

<p>This first group of barre chords are all major chords.  They are based on the basic major chords in open position.  The first finger will barre across the 2nd fret in this example.  The form name doesn't match the actual chord name.  Since these are all barred at the 2nd fret, you'll see that the name of the chord is always one whole step higher than the form name.  It is as if your first finger is now a capo at the second fret (well, it is).  Notice that in many cases the barre doesn't need to extend to string 6 (or even string 5).  The partial barre (across only a few strings) is very common.  If you wonder which barre chord to learn first, I suggest the E form.</p>
<div class="chordGroup">
<span class="col-md-2">B chord (A form)</span>
<span class="col-md-2">D chord (C form)</span>
<span class="col-md-2">E chord, (D form)</span>
<span class="col-md-2">F# chord (E form)</span>
<span class="col-md-4">A chord (G form)</span>

<span id="chord2-1" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord2-2" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord2-3" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord2-4" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord2-5" class="col-md-4"></span>
</div>
<p>A very common exercise for practicing each form is to move up the neck (8th fret).  Play the chord once trying to get a clear tone on every string. Then move down on fret to the 7th fret.  Play the chord again, listening to the tone of each string.  Repeat at each fret making adjustments to the barre finger to try to get a clear sound on those strings.  A common problem is the barre techniques is if the string is directly under the crease of your knuckle on the barre finger.  If so it is almost impossible to elimate a buzz.  You'll need to move your barre finger a little bit perpendicular to the neck so that the string is under a different area of your finger.</p>
<p>The value of barre chords is that you can move a shape around to different fret locations an create several different roots.  The concept of moveable shapes isn't limited to the barre technique however.  The following shapes are all selected notes from the above barre chords.  The barre technique isn't necessary to play these shapes you can use the normal 'on the fingertip' technique to play each of the three notes.  These are quite useful and fully legitimate major chords (the root is circled).  You can get aquainted with the concept of moveable shapes with chords that are easier to play than barre chords.  Add them to your personal library of chord forms.</p>
<p>
Forms that have a muted string on the interior of the chord (the first and third voicings) should use a muting technique that is useful to learn.  On the first voicing, with a slight tilt of the left hand, your third finger can touch the adjacient string and dampen (mute) that adjacient string.  Then you can strum across strings 5-2 and you'll hear the fretted notes on strings 5,4, and 2 but the third string will be muted.  The exact same technique can be used for the third voicing whose root is on string 4.</p>

<div class="chordGroup">
<span class="col-md-2">B chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">D chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">E chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">F# chord</span>
<span class="col-md-4">A chord</span>

<span id="chord3-1" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord3-2" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord3-3" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord3-4" class="col-md-2"></span>
<span id="chord3-5" class="col-md-4"></span>
</div>

<p>All of these forms are moveable.  A good exercise is to choose a letter name, for example Bb, and move each of the voicings to that root.  In each of the above five voicings, for a Bb root, the circled note would be (1) first fret/string 5, (2) 11th fret/string 2, (3) 8th fret/string 4 (4) 8th fret/string 4, (4) 3rd fret/string 3.</p>

<h2>Minor Barre Chords</h2>
<p>The Am, Dm and Em shapes are converted to barre forms.</p>
<div class="chordGroup">
<span class="col-md-4">Bm chord (Am form)</span>
<span class="col-md-4">Em chord, (Dm form)</span>
<span class="col-md-4">F#m chord (Em form)</span>

<span id="chord4-1" class="col-md-4"></span>
<span id="chord4-2" class="col-md-4"></span>
<span id="chord4-3" class="col-md-4"></span>
</div>
<p>
The same muting technique can be used to form three string forms for minor chords that useful to learn.  On the first voicing, with a slight tilt of the left hand, your third finger can touch the adjacient string and dampen (mute) that adjacient string.  Then you can strum across strings 5-2 and you'll hear the fretted notes on strings 5,4, and 2 but the third string will be muted.  The exact same technique can be used for the third voicing whose root is on string 4.</p>

<div class="chordGroup">
<span class="col-md-2">Bm chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">Dm chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">Em chord</span>
<span class="col-md-2">F#m chord</span>
<span class="col-md-4">Bbm chord</span>
